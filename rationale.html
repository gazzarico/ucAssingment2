        <h1>My Rationale</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Getting it working, hosting and becoming a full stack developer.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the fact that the website is functional and even through what seems to have been hundreds of hours testing I have eradicated all the mistakes that I had made. 
I learnt a lot of stuff during this assignment including how to write PHP and also how to set up a website to 'talk' to a database. <br>

My main concern about the finished product is that the website doesn't look very nice. I have only used some basic CSS which feels like a poor job however when I was using Bootstrap I couldn't get it to work and even though I watched tutorial videos online I could not find out exactly how to get it all linked together and actually working. <br>

The data I chose to collect is about expenses. I used the fields 'expense', 'cost' and 'description' in the database. My main pages focused on adding new expenses, deleting and updating. These pages were all based on the tutorials. Making a website which includes a database with CRUD capabilities was difficult and fixing the bugs in this proved to be a very long and arduous task. I got the site working and have included a budget page which sums all the costs and returns the sum of cost. Upon entering a budget figure the page returns how much is remaining. I added this page because tracking expenses is good but without knowing how much of the budget remains is a bit pointless.<br>

I spent hours, possibly days on sites such as stackoverflow looking for many answers to a whole plethora of questions that I had, either from not fully understanding initially how I had done something or to broaden my knowledge and skills further. As the debugging went on I got quite quick at fixing errors but the first few pages querying the database took me about a week to complete. <br>

I would like to have made more pages that did more complex stuff like for example on the budget page create a graph that breaks down the expense similarly to how it is on the NAB banking app however at this time that is out of my skill range.<br>

The hosting part and uploading of files are new to me and even though I signed up for a free hosting service it didn't really work because I wasn't able to share my database with other users. During testing on the local server the login page and all the database worked perfectly well however when I was ready to upload and go live my host wouldn't allow me to share my connection. Being totally new to setting up domains and getting a host I didn't know about this. I then upgraded my account to the premium service however this took another day to set up. I must have refreshed my browser a million times waiting for the service to go from 'pending' to 'active'. This was the most frustrating part of the whole process however I had another really unfortunate incident where MAMP unexpectedly shut down and upon restarting I had lost the mysql connection. I found after I deleted some temp files, mysql restarted however it took half a day to fix. It seems that this is a bit of a problem, the forums I read recommended using telnet to check the port 3306 but this was no good. The fix was really easy; just delete in few log files. <br>

For the coding side of things I have tried to keep it as clean as possible and to use comments where they are  needed. I tried to not use things like global variables however I did use them in the budget.php. In the code I have also added a div tag and then placed all the data elements in here. <br> </p>
        <br>
        <a class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" href="home.php" role="button">Home</a>
